#Project Title: GitHub Profile Search

Description:

The GitHub Profile Search is a web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles based on a username. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages the GitHub API to fetch and display user profile information in a clean, user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

Search Bar: A simple input field where users can type a GitHub username to fetch profile details.
Profile Display: After a successful search, the app shows key information about the user, including their GitHub avatar, bio, number of repositories, followers, and following count.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
API Integration: Uses the GitHub REST API to fetch real-time data about GitHub users, ensuring up-to-date profile information.
Error Handling: The app provides helpful error messages if no user is found or if there is an issue with the API request.
Technologies Used:

HTML for the structure and content of the page.
CSS for styling and making the page responsive.
JavaScript for fetching data from the GitHub API and dynamically updating the UI.
GitHub API for fetching user profile data.
How It Works:

The user enters a GitHub username in the search bar.
The application sends a request to the GitHub API to fetch the user's profile data.
The results, including the user's avatar, name, bio, and statistics, are displayed on the page.
If the username doesn't exist or an error occurs, an appropriate error message is shown.
This project demonstrates the ability to integrate third-party APIs into web applications and provides a simple, efficient tool for exploring GitHub profiles.
